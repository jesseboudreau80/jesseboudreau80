# 👋 Hey there — I’m Jesse Boudreau, CRCMP

**AI Strategy Leader | Compliance & Operations Executive | Aspiring Chief AI Officer**

I’m a seasoned operations and compliance leader evolving into a **Chief AI Officer–in-practice**, focused on how AI can transform complex, regulated business processes into scalable, auditable, and human-centered systems.

My background spans safety, compliance, operations, and leadership — and my current work centers on applying AI, automation, and systems thinking to help organizations move from *manual overload* to *structured intelligence* without sacrificing accountability or ethics.

## 🧭 CAIO Focus: How I Think About AI

I work at the intersection of:

- **AI strategy & enterprise transformation**
- **Governance, risk, and compliance**
- **Operations at scale**
- **Human-centered system design**

My core strength is not “building AI tools,” but **re-architecting how work gets done** — especially where regulations, reporting, and human judgment collide.

## 🧠 What I Specialize In

### **AI Strategy & Roadmapping**
- Translating business goals into realistic AI initiatives
- Identifying processes where automation reduces risk *and* effort
- Prioritizing initiatives based on impact, feasibility, and governance

### **Responsible & Governed AI**
- Designing AI workflows with auditability and traceability from day one
- Keeping humans in the loop where judgment, classification, or escalation matters
- Applying AI cautiously in regulated environments where mistakes have consequences

### **AI Systems & Workflow Architecture**
- Designing end-to-end AI-assisted workflows (not one-off scripts)
- Multi-agent and RAG-based architectures for structured decision support
- Integrating data from documents, forms, SOPs, and enterprise systems into unified pipelines

### **Human + AI Enablement**
- Using AI to *support* people, not replace them
- Decision support, guided workflows, and learning reinforcement
- Change management for teams adopting AI-driven processes

## 🔁 The Kind of AI Systems I’m Designing Toward

Rather than focusing on tools or industries, I focus on **repeatable system patterns** that can apply to *any* organization:

- **Single-Intake → Many Outputs**  
  Designing workflows where one standardized human submission feeds multiple downstream requirements instead of duplicative forms.

- **Living Records, Not Static Forms**  
  Systems where records can evolve over time — statuses change, facts are updated, and history is preserved — instead of being frozen the moment a PDF is generated.

- **Human-in-the-Loop Classification & Review**  
  AI assists with triage, categorization, and recommendations while humans retain final authority and override capability.

- **Automated Aggregation & Periodic Reporting**  
  Designing pipelines that continuously collect data so required periodic reports become outputs of the system — not separate projects every year.

These patterns are especially powerful for compliance-heavy processes (for example, safety reporting, regulatory tracking, audits, or internal controls), but they are **not limited to any single industry**.

---

## 🧠 My AI Philosophy

> AI should **reduce risk, increase clarity, and empower people** — not create chaos.

I prioritize:
- Practical automation over hype
- Explainability over black boxes
- Systems thinking over one-off tools
- Humans-in-the-loop by design

If an AI system can’t survive audits, edge cases, and real operators, it’s not ready for enterprise use.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Actively Used)

- **Languages & Frameworks:** Python, FastAPI, Flask, React  
- **AI & Agents:** LLMs, RAG pipelines, agent orchestration concepts, MCP  
- **Automation:** n8n, webhook-driven workflows, Power Automate concepts  
- **Data & Ops:** SharePoint, Excel / PowerBI, APIs, document intelligence  
- **Governance:** Role-based access, audit trails, structured outputs

---

## 🎯 Career Direction

I’m intentionally aligning my experience and hands-on work toward a future role as a:

**Chief AI Officer / Head of AI Strategy & Governance**

Where I can:
- Lead responsible enterprise AI adoption
- Design internal AI systems that scale across teams and locations
- Partner with executives on AI risk, governance, and ROI
- Turn AI into a durable, trusted business capability

## 🐾 Personal Fun Fact

My house doubles as a systems-stress test:
**3 dogs (including Princess Poppy the Frenchie), 6 parrots, and a cat named Milo with his own apartment.**  
If you want proof I can manage complex environments with unpredictable agents — there it is.
